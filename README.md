#### Complete App

[Sharks Rebuild Tracking (IN PROGRESS)](https://jobify.live/)

The San Jose Sharks aren't very good, but I love them and need something to keep me interested in the team while they go through this
rebuild. This application is being created to track the progress of the rebuild and will be updated frequently until completion in the coming months.

Below are just some guides/resources based around how I got this project up and running, more will be added as the project evolves
